# Dorm Designer
## What is it?
Dorm designer is a website for students to design their dorm and share their designs with their roommates. All furniture is automatically scaled to the right size and the amount of furniture left to add is also shown.
 
It can either be run locally as explained below or found [here](https://dorm-setup-assistant.vercel.app/). All data is stored on your own device to increase security (we don't store any of your floorplans).

## Running locally
This site is develloped using NextJS. It uses styled components for styling, KonvaJS for the canvas renderer and DexieJS for storing all floorplans locally on your computer in a database.

To run the development server run:

```bash
npm run dev
```
